		Our goal is to unite the animal rights and general leftist movements. We are a grassroots
		movement committed to total liberation. Rooted in anti-oppression and intersectionality, we
		fight for a world free from all systems of domination, including speciesism, capitalism, racism,
		and ecocide. Through direct action, education, and community care, we work toward collective
		freedom for all beings. Join us in building a just, compassionate future.
