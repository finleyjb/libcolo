	We are a grassroots movement committed to total liberation. Rooted in anti-oppression and
	intersectionality, we fight for a world free from all systems of domination, including speciesism,
	capitalism, racism, and ecocide. Through direct action, education, and community care, we work
	toward collective freedom for all beings. Join us in building a just, compassionate future.
