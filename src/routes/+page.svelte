    Our goal is to unite the animal rights and general leftist movements. We are a grassroots
    movement committed to total liberation. Rooted in anti-oppression and intersectionality, we
    fight for a world free from all systems of domination, including speciesism, capitalism, racism,
    and ecocide. Through direct action, education, and community care, we work toward collective
    freedom for all beings. Join us in building a just, compassionate future.
